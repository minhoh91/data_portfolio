Project A: Customer Onboarding & Health
1: The "Power User" Audit: Identifies elite customers by filtering for a specific frequency of high-value actions (direct deposits and purchases) within a rolling 30-day window.

2: The "Dormancy" Risk Report: Uses a LEFT JOIN to isolate active users who have had zero account activity in the last month, creating a target list for re-engagement campaigns.

3: New User "Activation" Rate: Calculates the conversion percentage of recent signups who successfully funded their accounts, measuring the effectiveness of the initial user funnel.

Project B: Revenue & Regional Performance
1: Regional Spend & Transaction Density: Breaks down interchange revenue by geographic location, ranking regions by total purchase volume and transaction frequency.

2: Daily Transaction Frequency Audit: A risk-mitigation query that identifies "High-Velocity" behavior by flagging users who exceed 5 purchases in a single calendar day.

3: Monthly Revenue Growth & Trend Analysis: Aggregates purchase volume by month to provide Finance with a chronological view of month-over-month (MoM) growth and seasonality.

Project C: Advanced Retention & Lifetime Value
1: The "First Deposit" Lead Time: Measures the "time-to-value" by calculating the exact number of days it takes for a new user to move from signup to their first direct deposit.

2: Month-over-Month User Retention: Identifies "Sticky" users by using LAG() and PERIOD_DIFF to find customers who transacted in consecutive months, regardless of the year-change.

3: Running Total of Revenue per User: Uses Window Functions to calculate a chronological cumulative spend for every user, allowing the business to identify "Whale" customers as their value grows over time

Technical Skills & SQL Proficiencies
Advanced Date Manipulation: Used EXTRACT(YEAR_MONTH), DATEDIFF, and PERIOD_DIFF to handle complex time-series data and year-over-year transitions.

Window Functions: Implemented LAG() for month-over-month retention analysis and SUM() OVER for calculating lifetime running totals (LTV).

Analytical CTEs (Common Table Expressions): Leveraged multiple CTEs to layer logic, such as normalizing transaction dates before performing retention math.

Funnel & Retention Logic: Built queries to measure "Time-to-Value" (activation) and "Sticky" user behavior (consecutive month retention).

Data Aggregation & Filtering: Proficiency in GROUP BY, HAVING, and complex CASE WHEN statements for conditional metrics (Activation Rates).

Performance Optimization: Utilized DISTINCT and JOIN optimization to ensure queries run efficiently on high-volume transaction datasets.
