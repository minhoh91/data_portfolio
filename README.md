users  
  user_id (PK): Unique identifier for each customer.  
  signup_date: The date the user joined the platform.  
  status: Current account standing (e.g., Active, Inactive, Pending).  
  sales_region: Geographic location (e.g., North, South, East, West).  
  
transactions  
  transaction_id (PK): Unique identifier for each transaction.  
  user_id (FK): Links the transaction to a specific user.  
  merchant_id (FK): Links the transaction to a specific merchant.  
  transaction_date: The date the purchase or deposit occurred.  
  amount: The dollar value of the transaction.  
  transaction_type: The category of movement (e.g., Purchase, Deposit, Withdrawal).  
  
merchants  
  merchant_id (PK): Unique identifier for each vendor.  
  merchant_name: The name of the business (e.g., Amazon, Starbucks).  
  category: Business industry (e.g., Groceries, Dining, Travel, Luxury).  
  risk_level: A scale of 1–5 indicating the likelihood of fraudulent activity.  
  
Project A: Customer Onboarding & Health  
1: The "Power User" Audit: Identifies elite customers by filtering for a specific frequency of high-value actions (direct deposits and purchases) within a rolling 30-day window.

2: The "Dormancy" Risk Report: Uses a LEFT JOIN to isolate active users who have had zero account activity in the last month, creating a target list for re-engagement campaigns.

3: New User "Activation" Rate: Calculates the conversion percentage of recent signups who successfully funded their accounts, measuring the effectiveness of the initial user funnel.

Project B: Revenue & Regional Performance  
1: Regional Spend & Transaction Density: Breaks down interchange revenue by geographic location, ranking regions by total purchase volume and transaction frequency.

2: Daily Transaction Frequency Audit: A risk-mitigation query that identifies "High-Velocity" behavior by flagging users who exceed 5 purchases in a single calendar day.

3: Monthly Revenue Growth & Trend Analysis: Aggregates purchase volume by month to provide Finance with a chronological view of month-over-month (MoM) growth and seasonality.

Project C: Advanced Retention & Lifetime Value  
1: The "First Deposit" Lead Time: Measures the "time-to-value" by calculating the exact number of days it takes for a new user to move from signup to their first direct deposit.

2: Month-over-Month User Retention: Identifies "Sticky" users by using LAG() and PERIOD_DIFF to find customers who transacted in consecutive months, regardless of the year-change.

3: Running Total of Revenue per User: Uses Window Functions to calculate a chronological cumulative spend for every user, allowing the business to identify "Whale" customers as their value grows over time

Project D: Merchant Ecosystem & Risk Strategy  
1: The "Luxury vs. Necessity" Persona Analysis: Joins all three tables to identify high-spend luxury shoppers within specific regions, helping marketing define high-affinity consumer segments.  

2: Merchant Risk Exposure Report: Flags high-risk merchants by joining transaction volume with risk levels to identify vendors with suspicious velocity or high-value transaction averages.

3: Category Diversification Metric: Uses CTEs and Cross Joins to calculate the variety of merchant categories a user shops in compared to the platform average, measuring user wallet share and engagement.

Project E: A/B Test Analysis & Experimentation   
1. The "Incentive Impact" Conversion Audit: Evaluated a "Signup Incentive" experiment by joining experimental cohorts with transaction data; utilized SQL CTEs and Left Joins to calculate the Activation Rate (conversion from signup to first deposit) for Control and Test groups, identifying the statistical lift generated by the incentive.

Technical Skills & SQL Proficiencies  
Advanced Date Manipulation: Used EXTRACT(YEAR_MONTH), DATEDIFF, and PERIOD_DIFF to handle complex time-series data and year-over-year transitions.

Window Functions & Benchmarking: Implemented LAG() for retention analysis, SUM() OVER for lifetime totals (LTV), and CROSS JOINs to compare individual user metrics against platform-wide averages.

Multi-Entity Data Integration: Expert at performing complex three-way joins across User, Transaction, and Merchant dimensions to uncover cross-functional business insights.

Analytical CTEs (Common Table Expressions): Leveraged multiple CTEs to layer logic, such as normalizing transaction dates and isolating sub-populations before performing final aggregations.

Risk & Funnel Logic: Built queries to measure "Time-to-Value" (activation) and "Risk Audit Status" by flagging high-velocity behavior and high-risk merchant profiles.

Data Aggregation & Filtering: Proficiency in GROUP BY, HAVING, and complex CASE WHEN statements for conditional metrics and persona categorization.

Performance Optimization: Utilized DISTINCT and JOIN optimization to ensure queries run efficiently on high-volume transaction datasets.

A/B Testing & Experimentation: Experienced in measuring feature impact by comparing Control and Test variants; skilled in calculating lift metrics and conversion funnels to drive data-backed business decisions.
